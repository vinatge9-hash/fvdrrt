# PeakFit Gym Website

This project contains a complete, production-ready three-page gym website generated from a single-category prompt (Gym/Fitness).

What you get
- index.html: Home page with a full-screen hero, programs overview, testimonials, and a gallery.
- about.html: Programs overview, trainer bios, and facility highlights.
- contact.html: Contact form and location information with a simple client-side submission message.
- Responsive, mobile-first design built with Tailwind CSS (via CDN).
- Font pairing tailored to the Gym category (Oswald for headings, Roboto for body).
- Background image placeholders using the prescribed https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1756758766175-f2c47d40d646?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw5fHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1ODcxOTUyNXww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080 syntax for hero sections.
- Internal navigation across pages.
- Lightweight, accessible markup with semantic HTML.

How to run
- Open index.html in a modern browser. No server is required for static hosting.
- For a local development workflow, you can serve the files with any static server (e.g., Python http.server, live-server, etc.).

How to customize
- Update text content in each HTML file to reflect your gymâ€™s branding and offerings.
- Replace image placeholders in src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1591470943257-26f29f263ee6?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=M3w3ODkyNDZ8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw2fHwuLi58ZW58MHwwfHx8MTc1ODcxOTUyNXww&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=80&w=1080" with your own assets or keep placeholders for a design prototype.
- If you need more pages (e.g., Pricing, FAQs, Blog), I can extend the site in a backward-compatible way.

Project fundamentals
- Tailwind CSS classes exclusively for styling (no external CSS files).
- Semantic HTML5: header, nav, main, section, article, footer.
- Accessible structure with descriptive alt text for images.
